Chapter 1
-Beginning of the chapters
-summary, chapter highlights 
-terms 

Notes
-reading of text, dicussion questions
-videos, not too many stats...

elements
physical geography vs cultural geography
-geog 306 is cultural based geography
-----------------------------------------------
five themes of geography
-location
-place
-human/envioronment interaction
-movement
-regions

---------------------------------------------
question-relative question
-interaction bettewwnn and among places
-how places are located

-----------------------------------------------

theme 2: place
-physcial characterices
.. animal life, rivers climiate mountatins
-cultural characterics 
.. artchitechures

theme 3: human environment/interaction
- positive and negative ways interact surrondings

theme 4: movement
-people interact with people, place...
.. communicaton, exchange products. info
.. clothing label. wher does your clothing origniate and how did it get there.

theme 5: regions
-unifying characteristics-physicsal, cultural, ethic.
how does it change over time
-divide into manageable units of study


------------------------------------------
Map figure display (view slides)
-the world
-realms
-regions
-scales (optional u learned this already)

-----------------------------------------
Sustainable Geographic
-Human
-Physical
-Biologic
(all related and "hollistic approach")

--------------------------------------------
Ecological Age
-Ecology interactionof living organisms and physical work.
-new way of thing
-shift thinking of conquering nature
.. a part of nature rather than apart
-Living sustaianble what does it mean
-Path of US and Canada in relation of sustainability.
-----------------------------------------

antropocentic = human centered
-US is the most consumed nation

----------------------------------------

-Energy consumption 5% of the population that create 25%
of greenhouse gassses 


unintended consequences
Coal ash, toxic byproduct burning coal. powerplant is
mixed with wahter to create slurry stored in unlined
ponds 


Coal Fly Ash
-131 millions tons of 460 plants stored in 1300 location
-50% stored in dams
-no federal regulations by EPA to control fly ash as a 
hazardous material
-contains arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and mercury

-----------------------------------------------------

unintended consequences but negatively affect the,
Economics - cost money, tax payers paying
Environment -destructive areas
Communities -water becomes undrinkable for people

External costs
Deforestation-loss of bio diversity
-

-----------------------------------------------------

The relationship of regions, water, and corps
-Great plains to be irregated from the underlying
Ogallala aquifer. Water used to irrigate humid weather
crops far exceeds sustainable standards.
-ex. replacing crops that consumes more water than
intended crops. we use them and take them


--------------------------------------------------
Ecosystems
-Interconnected geo ara
-scale

--------------------------------------------------

Ecoregion
-A relative large unit of land and water defined by
influneces of shared climate and geolgogy,
main fations that determine distrubution of plants 
water..

------------------------------------------------

Subregions
- Black Hills  (examples) pictures

------------------------------------------------

Boundaries and borders
-political vs ecoregions
-ex. Colorado river covers like 5 states.
-ex. California /Arizona border.

Unsustainable development
(more examples)
-Las Vegas, Los Angeles, ("kind of stole water")


-----------------------------------------------
Conclusion
-Geography- Ability to connect info about a place across
many disciplines
-Key to sustainable future
-US and Canada lead world
.. Consumption (sustainable)
.. groiwth (ecological)
.. progress (cooperative)
-Paradigm shifts of hollistic systems

Native American Boomtown - America by the Numbers (disc 1 #4)
1. How much is the oil reserve worth to the reservation in terms of money and jobs?
