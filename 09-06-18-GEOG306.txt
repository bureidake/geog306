Leave it to Beavers (2014)

1. How have beavers changed the US/Canada landscape? With what outcomes?
- They benefit areas that needed water. They created ecosystems such as rivers, trees, dams and etc. 
- "Create deserts to gardens" In Nevada for example. Suzy Creek

2. How important were they? In what ways was this positive for ecosystems? How? And what about specifically for people?
- They are important to do land development. At a point they where soughted for fashion reasons.
- They made dams that can filter water.
- They benefit other animals like safety (keep out of predators (bears, wolves, and ...)), food when they make their own ponds.
- Farmers need beavers so they can provide water for their farm needs.
- Few people can rehab trumatized beavers become the beaver they suppose to be.
